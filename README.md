# Hate Speech Filtering
Abstract
The society in general has been more conscious about hate speech in recent years. There are less and less individuals who express hate speech in public places in real life, as they would be heavily criticized by the general public, and in worse cases, legal actions would be taken against them. However, the online world is completely different to real life. It is almost a completely anonymous world where people can say whatever they want without fearing to face the consequences. Easier and cheaper access to the internet means billions of people are online everyday noting down their thoughts and ideas. However, the internet being more accessible also means vulnerable individuals are more likely be targeted to abuses and hate speech.
This project is a web extension that aims to minimize usersâ€™ exposure of online textual hate speech contents. The application utilises a custom built text scraper and Natural Language Processing (NLTK) techniques to extract and process raw textual data; textual feature extraction functions (BoW, TF-IDF) and Machine Learning models(SVM, Logistic Regression) to classify hate speech contents; JavaScript, HTML and CSS to notify users about potential hate speech content and block out the webpage with a splash screen.
