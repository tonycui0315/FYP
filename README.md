# Hate Speech Filtering


This is a third year project for MSci Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.

This project is a web extension that aims to minimize usersâ€™ exposure of online textual hate speech contents. The application utilises a custom built text scraper and Natural Language Processing (NLTK) techniques to extract and process raw textual data; textual feature extraction functions (BoW, TF-IDF) and Machine Learning models(SVM, Logistic Regression) to classify hate speech contents; JavaScript, HTML and CSS to notify users about potential hate speech content and block out the webpage with a splash screen (GUI NOT IMPLEMENTED YET).
